								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<ol>
<li> Ensure that your house is maintained cleaned and properly maintaining the cleanliness of your<br />
house would serve a two-fold purpose — Firstly, it would ensure that your home place is completely<br />
hygienic, keeping you and your loved one&#8217;s safe from any illnesses, allergies or diseases that may<br />
have otherwise occurred had the house not been clean. Secondly, it would be a way to implement<br />
Vastu in your house and would bring a large amount of positive and success to people<br />
who resides in the house.</li>
<li>Make sure to decorate important or significant areas deemed by Vastu The region that surrounds<br />
the front door of your house is one of the most significant areas and hence must be decorated.<br />
Other places include the Guest room, room where you pray or worship, the regions surrounded by<br />
windows among others. Decoration could be done in a number of ways — you could place flowering<br />
to enhance the fragrance as well. Or, you could illuminate your house with candles and lamps that<br />
consume less energy. You could do both to ensure complete Vastu and a positive environment. A<br />
<a href="http://www.vastusouq.in/vastu-consultant-for-interior-design">vastu consultant for interior design</a> would help by recommending the best way to have Vastu in<br />
your house.</li>
<li>Eliminate negativity and promote the positivity of your house One important tip to be considered is<br />
that all shoes, chappals, and other footwear must preferably be removed and kept outside the<br />
house. They should definitely not enter the significant areas of your house like the prayer room.<br />
This would also promote the hygiene of your house as any dirt, germs, dust, and bacteria that the<br />
footwear may have gathered from outside would not enter your house. If required, you could buy<br />
separate footwear that is only used inside your house. Another good way to ensure vastu compliant<br />
homes is to ring bells while praying or even talking about the New Year. Such resonance removes<br />
negative aspects and promotes positivity.</li>
</ol>
<p>The New Year is here and it means a clean slate for many. Mistakes that were made earlier could be<br />
rectified with the newfound motivation many people have due to the New Year. One way to<br />
maintain positivity is to adopt <a href="http://www.vastusouq.in/vastu-expert-for-buying-home">Vastu in your house</a>.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Vastu and Feng Shuai are quite a debated topic; however, they have considerable role play towards establishing wealth, happiness and peace in the lives of individuals. If you have been planning to build your new house, or set-up an office, it is necessary that you have kept the Vastu in mind for taking up the big call. Now-a-days, modern interiors can solve numerous Vastu dosh or Vastu Problem. In order to keep your surroundings free of Vastu Dosh, here are a few key recommendations by Vastu experts regarding the furniture and interior alignment.</p>
<p><strong>Staircase Constructions</strong></p>
<p>It is most likely that if you are constructing your own house, most people skip the <a href="http://www.vastusouq.in/vastu-compliant-homes">Vastu compliance home</a>. However, such instances are never seen in flats and apartments. But, the common mistake is the placement of the staircases in the center of the house. In case, if you have done likewise, it will bring bad luck and health for the family. Thus, keeping that in mind, please make sure that you have kept the interiors properly organised.</p>
<p><strong>Entry Gate</strong></p>
<p>At the time of the construction, it is essential that proper focus is given to entry gates. If you have kept the entry gates in the southern direction, it will bring major health issues for the family members as the God of Death named Yam, as per Hindu Mythology is the dweller of the southern direction. But, just in case, if you have no other alternative but to settle for the entry gate in the southern direction, make sure that either they are built with great heights, or they have wood as their primary component for construction.</p>
<p><strong>Kitchen Placement</strong></p>
<p>At the time of planning for the interiors, it is necessary that you have kept it in the south-east direction as Agni Dev, or God of Fire as per Hindu Mythology controls and manages the realms in the south east direction.</p>
<p>At the time of getting the house constructed, or the interiors designed, it is necessary that you have kept these small details in mind.</p>

However, if the five elements of the nature are not in harmony in our home, our safe haven can easily become a place of negativity. Thus, it is essential to follow the principles of Vastu while decorating your home as it is the science of space and directions responsible for maintaining equilibrium. If you don&#8217;t possess knowledge about this branch of science, <a href="http://www.vastusouq.in/vastu-compliant-homes">vastu compliant homes</a> expert. There some basic and most popular Vastu tips than you can easily implement in bringing balance and harmony in your home. Listed below are some important Vastu tips which when implemented will bring joy and prosperity to your home.</p>
<p><strong>1. Have a Name Plate</strong></p>
<p>Having a nameplate outside your house indicates a sense of authority and establishes that you are the owner. Vastu experts say that having a nameplate increases the flow of beneficial opportunities to the owner and brings positivity to the family.</p>
<p><strong>2. Use Wind Chimes</strong></p>
<p>The tinkling bells of wind chimes have another purpose apart from being soothing to the ears. They help break patterns of negative energies present in the surroundings and encourages a flow of positive energy inside the house.</p>

<p>A cluttered and dirty space is considered inauspicious from the Vastu viewpoint. If you wish to attract positivity to your residence, make sure you clean the place regularly. Besides that, it is necessary to keep your surroundings clean in order to get rid of any negative energy.</p>
<p><strong>2. Lemon and Salt To Eliminate Negativity</strong></p>

<strong><br />

<p><strong>5. Don&#8217;t Place Mirrors In The Bedroom</strong></p>
