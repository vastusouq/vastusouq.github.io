								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<ol>
<li> Ensure that your house is maintained cleaned and properly maintaining the cleanliness of your<br />
house would serve a two-fold purpose — Firstly, it would ensure that your home place is completely<br />
hygienic, keeping you and your loved one&#8217;s safe from any illnesses, allergies or diseases that may<br />
have otherwise occurred had the house not been clean. Secondly, it would be a way to implement<br />
Vastu in your house and would bring a large amount of positive and success to people<br />
who resides in the house.</li>
<li>Make sure to decorate important or significant areas deemed by Vastu The region that surrounds<br />
the front door of your house is one of the most significant areas and hence must be decorated.<br />
Other places include the Guest room, room where you pray or worship, the regions surrounded by<br />
windows among others. Decoration could be done in a number of ways — you could place flowering<br />
to enhance the fragrance as well. Or, you could illuminate your house with candles and lamps that<br />
consume less energy. You could do both to ensure complete Vastu and a positive environment. A<br />
<a href="http://www.vastusouq.in/vastu-consultant-for-interior-design">vastu consultant for interior design</a> would help by recommending the best way to have Vastu in<br />
your house.</li>
<li>Eliminate negativity and promote the positivity of your house One important tip to be considered is<br />
that all shoes, chappals, and other footwear must preferably be removed and kept outside the<br />
house. They should definitely not enter the significant areas of your house like the prayer room.<br />
This would also promote the hygiene of your house as any dirt, germs, dust, and bacteria that the<br />
footwear may have gathered from outside would not enter your house. If required, you could buy<br />
separate footwear that is only used inside your house. Another good way to ensure vastu compliant<br />
homes is to ring bells while praying or even talking about the New Year. Such resonance removes<br />
negative aspects and promotes positivity.</li>
</ol>
<p>The New Year is here and it means a clean slate for many. Mistakes that were made earlier could be<br />
rectified with the newfound motivation many people have due to the New Year. One way to<br />
maintain positivity is to adopt <a href="http://www.vastusouq.in/vastu-expert-for-buying-home">Vastu in your house</a>.</p>
