								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For centuries, Buddha paintings &amp; statues are of great significance among both Hindus and Buddhists across the world. Varieties of designs and representations of Lord Buddha are available in the market including Buddha&#8217;s head, laughing Buddha, blessing Buddha, reclining Buddha and medication Buddha.</p>
<p>Blessing Buddha is a symbol of tranquility. Among the seven factors of enlightenment, Lord Buddha taught the world the importance of tranquility, which means “sense of peace and quiet.” You may find that the statue has his right hand raised which depicts fearless trait of the inner soul. It is believed that this posture of Lord Buddha signifies a shield that helps the souls to fight against any fear, deception, and rage.</p>
<p>So, have a blessing Buddha for your <strong>home or office interior</strong>, and bring back hope and harmony near you and your beloved. It is easily available in any handicraft shop or online store.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An office is considered to be the second house for an employee as he spends most of the time there. So it becomes essential to have a positive and prosperous environment in the office. It helps to increase the productivity and efficiency of employees, and ultimately the payouts for the businesses.</p>
<p>Since the Vedic times, Vastu Shastra plays a pivotal role in boosting up positive energy and harmony at the homes and workplaces. Being an experienced vastu consultant for office, we at Vastusouq enlist some beneficial vastu tips that will boost your business.</p>
<ul>
<li>Irregularly shaped plots are considered to be inauspicious for offices so try to avoid them and make a deal only for square and rectangle shaped premises. It is believed that such structural foundations gladly receive the exchange of good ideas and positive vibes.</li>
<li>If you are dealing in marketing then, it is better to avoid the use of colors like blue and black. North direction seems to be pleasing for driving newer opportunities and more financial growth.</li>
<li>During our journey as vastu consultant for offices, we generally found that most of the business people don’t pay attention to the correct position of their bins. However, according to Vastu Shastra, we suggest placing the trashes away from the east direction. It may bring certain difficulties while dealing with government authorities.</li>
<li>Your entrance door is highly influential for the growth of the business, so make sure, you have a better and durable front gate. It signifies stability and strength.</li>
<li>The center of the office should be left empty and the sitting area should be either towards East or North. It helps to boost up the psychological well-being and efficiency of employees.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, if you are planning to open a new office or want to adjust the premises according to Vastu, then contact a leading <a href="http://www.vastusouq.in/Vastu-consultant-for-office"><strong>vastu consultant for offices</strong></a> like vastusouq for better results.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a competitive world like ours, it is no surprise that every business owner is driven solely by the purpose of making more profit. To accomplish this, company owners leave no stones unturned. With so many challenges to overcome, it is no wonder that Vastu has emerged to be one of the most effective tools to enhance the flow of prosperity and wealth of the company.</p>
<p><strong>1. Monitor The Construction</strong></p>
<p>If you are just starting in the business world, keep some of the important Vastu principles in mind. If you don&#8217;t have enough knowledge on the subject, it is better to take help from a <a href="http://www.vastusouq.in/Vastu-consultant-for-office">Vastu consultant for office</a> space or <a href="http://www.vastusouq.in/vastu-consultant-for-showroom">vastu consultant for showroom</a>. Get an architectural plan made according to Vastu rules and proceed accordingly.<br />
<strong><br />
2. Focus on The Colours</strong></p>
<p>Often, home and office owners tend to overlook the colour scheme they incorporate during building the place. It is important to know the essence of your business and choose a colour accordingly. Wood furnishings and including soothing colours like green and blue in your interior as well as in the company logo brings harmony.</p>
<p><strong>3. Use Regular Shapes</strong></p>
<p>When you are done finalizing  the colour scheme of your surroundings, make sure that the shape of your furniture is either square or rectangle. Oval or circular tables are not considered appropriate according to Vastu. Also, make sure that the owner&#8217;s chair and table are elevated as compared to the rest of the staff to imbibe a sense of power and authority.</p>
<p><strong>4. Monitor The Landscape</strong></p>
<p>Monitoring the landscape of your surroundings is a must. An office located in a serene location with lush greenery witnesses more harmony and a greater growth.<br />
<strong><br />
5. Positive Wall Frames</strong></p>
<p>Putting up motivational and inspirational posters and pictures on the wall can contribute greatly to the prosperity of the business; as it motivates the employees and makes them feel empowered and confident.</p>
<p>Vastu Shastra aids in bringing out the hidden energy and distributes it in a way that the company achieves maximum positive outcomes with minimum efforts. It also creates a healthy work environment by initiating peace and harmony among the workers.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Since ages, flowers have been synonymous with tradition and prosperity. Besides being the perfect gift for occasions like anniversaries, birthdays and Valentine’s Day to express love, flowers have a hidden deeper meaning and significance. Even the most powerful words fail to express what these colourful flowers manage to say. They are also representative of various human emotions.</p>
<p>Speaking of emotions, an office is a place where more often or not, emotions remain unexpressed. The place can be full of both positive and negative emotions. Spiritual flowers can help maintain peace and harmony by sending positive vibes to the place and the people involved. If you consult a <a href="http://www.vastusouq.in/Vastu-consultant-for-office">Vastu consultant for office</a>, he or she is likely to present you with the list of spiritually charged flowers for office. They are mentioned below. Let us take a look.</p>
<p><strong>1. Lotus</strong></p>
<p>Lotus is directly related to the divine power. It is said to attract positive energy from the almighty and spread it around. However, since it&#8217;s not always practically possible to keep lotuses in your office, keeping a picture of this flower is powerful enough to draw the required energy.</p>
<p><strong>2. Lily</strong></p>
<p>Have you ever wondered why lilies are the primary flowers in almost all weddings? This is due to the fact that they represent commitment. They spread a sense of commitment to the atmosphere and also facilitate important deals by instilling trust between the parties.</p>
<p><strong>3. Hyacinth</strong></p>
<p>Hyacinth is known to shower spiritual healing upon those in close proximity. It prevents individuals from abruptly reaching to conclusions and develops a higher level of patience.</p>
<p><strong>4. Daisies</strong></p>
<p>If you are looking for improving employee relationships and internal healing, daisies are the perfect choice for your office. They help in eliminating negativity from the minds of workers and help maintain an amicable relationship among co-workers.</p>
<p><strong>5. Chrysanthemum</strong></p>
<p>The literal meaning of Chrysanthemum is &#8216;golden flower.&#8217; It symbolizes unity and therefore, is a must in an office. In some cultures, it is also known to prevent addictions.</p>
<p><strong>6.  Bird of Paradise</strong></p>
<p>Bird of Paradise represents happiness, freedom, and success. They also attract more revenue and wealth and are perfect for keeping in a sales company office.</p>
