								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a competitive world like ours, it is no surprise that every business owner is driven solely by the purpose of making more profit. To accomplish this, company owners leave no stones unturned. With so many challenges to overcome, it is no wonder that Vastu has emerged to be one of the most effective tools to enhance the flow of prosperity and wealth of the company.</p>
<p><strong>1. Monitor The Construction</strong></p>
<p>If you are just starting in the business world, keep some of the important Vastu principles in mind. If you don&#8217;t have enough knowledge on the subject, it is better to take help from a <a href="http://www.vastusouq.in/Vastu-consultant-for-office">Vastu consultant for office</a> space or <a href="http://www.vastusouq.in/vastu-consultant-for-showroom">vastu consultant for showroom</a>. Get an architectural plan made according to Vastu rules and proceed accordingly.<br />
<strong><br />
2. Focus on The Colours</strong></p>
<p>Often, home and office owners tend to overlook the colour scheme they incorporate during building the place. It is important to know the essence of your business and choose a colour accordingly. Wood furnishings and including soothing colours like green and blue in your interior as well as in the company logo brings harmony.</p>
<p><strong>3. Use Regular Shapes</strong></p>
<p>When you are done finalizing  the colour scheme of your surroundings, make sure that the shape of your furniture is either square or rectangle. Oval or circular tables are not considered appropriate according to Vastu. Also, make sure that the owner&#8217;s chair and table are elevated as compared to the rest of the staff to imbibe a sense of power and authority.</p>
<p><strong>4. Monitor The Landscape</strong></p>
<p>Monitoring the landscape of your surroundings is a must. An office located in a serene location with lush greenery witnesses more harmony and a greater growth.<br />
<strong><br />
5. Positive Wall Frames</strong></p>
<p>Putting up motivational and inspirational posters and pictures on the wall can contribute greatly to the prosperity of the business; as it motivates the employees and makes them feel empowered and confident.</p>
<p>Vastu Shastra aids in bringing out the hidden energy and distributes it in a way that the company achieves maximum positive outcomes with minimum efforts. It also creates a healthy work environment by initiating peace and harmony among the workers.</p>
