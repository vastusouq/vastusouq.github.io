								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An office is considered to be the second house for an employee as he spends most of the time there. So it becomes essential to have a positive and prosperous environment in the office. It helps to increase the productivity and efficiency of employees, and ultimately the payouts for the businesses.</p>
<p>Since the Vedic times, Vastu Shastra plays a pivotal role in boosting up positive energy and harmony at the homes and workplaces. Being an experienced vastu consultant for office, we at Vastusouq enlist some beneficial vastu tips that will boost your business.</p>
<ul>
<li>Irregularly shaped plots are considered to be inauspicious for offices so try to avoid them and make a deal only for square and rectangle shaped premises. It is believed that such structural foundations gladly receive the exchange of good ideas and positive vibes.</li>
<li>If you are dealing in marketing then, it is better to avoid the use of colors like blue and black. North direction seems to be pleasing for driving newer opportunities and more financial growth.</li>
<li>During our journey as vastu consultant for offices, we generally found that most of the business people don’t pay attention to the correct position of their bins. However, according to Vastu Shastra, we suggest placing the trashes away from the east direction. It may bring certain difficulties while dealing with government authorities.</li>
<li>Your entrance door is highly influential for the growth of the business, so make sure, you have a better and durable front gate. It signifies stability and strength.</li>
<li>The center of the office should be left empty and the sitting area should be either towards East or North. It helps to boost up the psychological well-being and efficiency of employees.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, if you are planning to open a new office or want to adjust the premises according to Vastu, then contact a leading <a href="http://www.vastusouq.in/Vastu-consultant-for-office"><strong>vastu consultant for offices</strong></a> like vastusouq for better results.</p>
